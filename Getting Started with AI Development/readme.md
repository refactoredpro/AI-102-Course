- Ask questions in communities â€“ seriously, people love helping
- Keep a learning journal (future you will appreciate the notes)

### Making It Stick:
- Build while you learn â€“ theory without practice is just expensive trivia
- Try different approaches to the same problem (there's rarely one "right" way)
- Break big concepts down until they're bite-sized
- Test everything twice, debug everything three times

### Community Magic:
- Share your projects, even the broken ones (especially the broken ones)
- Give feedback to other learners â€“ teaching helps you learn
- Find an accountability buddy or study group
- Attend virtual events when you can â€“ networking is still a thing
