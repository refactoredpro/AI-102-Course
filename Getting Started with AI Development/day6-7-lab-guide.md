Front: When should you use Azure AI Foundry vs custom code?
Back: AI Foundry: Quick prototypes, standard patterns, 
      low-code needs
      Custom code: Unique requirements, full control, 
      complex integrations
```

**Azure Services:**
```
Front: What is Azure OpenAI Service?

      3. Computer Vision
      4. Translator
```

**Best Practices:**
```
Front: What should you monitor for AI agents?

Usage (API calls, tokens), Quality (satisfaction, 
accuracy), Costs (compute, storage, API)

Front: Key cost optimization strategies?
Back: 1. Cache common responses
      2. Use appropriate model sizes
      3. Implement auto-scaling

## Day 7: Practice and Self-Assessment

### Part 1: Hands-On Practice Scenarios (90 minutes)

Complete these practical exercises:

**Exercise 1: Agent Design Challenge**
Design an agent for a restaurant booking system:

Requirements:
- Handle reservations via chat
- Check availability
- Confirm bookings
- Send reminders
- Handle modifications

Your Design:
```yaml
Agent Name: 
Primary Purpose:
Architecture Pattern:
Required Azure Services:
  - 
  - 
  - 
Integration Points:
  - 
  - 
Key Workflows:
  1. 
  2. 
  3. 
```

**Exercise 2: Code Implementation**
Implement a simple Semantic Kernel function:

```python
# Task: Create a function that summarizes product reviews
# and extracts sentiment

# Your implementation here:
from semantic_kernel.functions import kernel_function

class ReviewAnalyzer:
    @kernel_function(
        name="analyze_reviews",
        description="Analyzes product reviews"
    )
    async def analyze_reviews(self, reviews: list) -> dict:
        # Your code here
        pass
```

**Exercise 3: Architecture Diagram**
Draw the architecture for a multi-agent customer service system:
