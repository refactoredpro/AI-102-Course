## Part 1: Understanding AI Agents (30 minutes)

### Background
AI agents represent a paradigm shift from reactive systems to proactive, goal-oriented assistants. Unlike traditional chatbots that respond to queries, AI agents can perceive their environment, reason about it, and take autonomous actions to achieve specific goals.

### Key Concepts to Explore

**1. Agent vs. Chatbot**
- **Traditional Chatbot**: Responds to queries, follows scripts, limited context
- **AI Agent**: Perceives environment, maintains state, takes autonomous actions, learns from interactions

**2. Core Agent Components**
- **Perception**: How agents gather information (sensors, APIs, user input)
- **Reasoning**: Decision-making processes (LLMs, rule engines, planning algorithms)
- **Action**: How agents affect their environment (API calls, automation, responses)
- **Memory**: State management and context retention

### Activity 1: Conceptual Mapping
Create a comparison chart:

| Aspect | Traditional Chatbot | AI Agent |
|--------|-------------------|----------|
| Initiative | Reactive | Proactive |
| Context | Limited | Extensive |
| Actions | Predefined responses | Dynamic actions |
| Learning | Static | Adaptive |
| Integration | Limited | Multi-system |

**Reflection Questions:**
1. What makes an AI agent "intelligent"?
2. How does autonomy change user expectations?
3. What risks might autonomous agents introduce?

## Part 2: Real-World Agent Research (45 minutes)

### Research Guidelines
You'll investigate three companies using AI agents effectively. Focus on:
- Business problem being solved
- Agent capabilities demonstrated
- Measurable impact or benefits
- Technology stack (if disclosed)

### Suggested Research Categories

**Customer Service**

- Look for: Response time improvements, customer satisfaction scores, cost savings

**Healthcare**
- Companies: Babylon Health, Ada Health, Buoy Health
- Look for: Diagnostic accuracy, patient engagement, healthcare accessibility

**Finance**
- Companies: JPMorgan Chase (COIN), Bank of America (Erica), Capital One (Eno)
- Look for: Transaction processing, fraud detection, personalized financial advice

**E-commerce**
- Companies: Amazon (Alexa Shopping), Alibaba (AliMe), Shopify (Kit)
- Look for: Conversion rates, personalization effectiveness, operational efficiency

### Research Template
For each company, document:

```
Company: [Name]
Industry: [Sector]
Agent Name/Type: [If applicable]

Problem Solved:
- [Primary challenge addressed]
- [Secondary benefits]

Agent Capabilities:
- [List 3-5 key features]

Measurable Impact:
- [Quantifiable results if available]
- [Qualitative improvements]

Technology Notes:
- [Known platforms/tools used]
- [Integration points]

Why It Works:
- [Key success factors]
- [Lessons learned]
```

### Activity 2: Deep Dive Analysis
Choose one company from your research and answer:

1. **Scale of Implementation**: Is this a pilot or production deployment?
2. **User Experience**: How do users interact with the agent?
3. **Business Model**: How does the agent create value?
4. **Technical Architecture**: What can you infer about the system design?
5. **Future Potential**: How might this agent evolve?

## Part 3: Azure AI Ecosystem Overview (30 minutes)

### Understanding Azure's Role
Azure provides a comprehensive platform for building, deploying, and managing AI agents at scale.

### Key Azure Services for AI Agents

**1. Azure OpenAI Service**
- GPT models for natural language understanding
- Fine-tuning capabilities
- Enterprise security and compliance

**2. Azure Cognitive Services**
- Vision APIs for image analysis
- Speech services for voice interaction
- Language understanding (LUIS)
- Translator for multilingual support

**3. Azure Machine Learning**
- Custom model training
- MLOps for model management
- AutoML for rapid prototyping

**4. Azure AI Foundry**
- Low-code agent development
- Pre-built templates
- Integration connectors

### Activity 3: Service Mapping
Create a mind map showing how Azure services could support an AI agent for one of your researched use cases:

```
[Use Case: Customer Service Agent]
         |
    [Required Capabilities]
    /    |    \
Speech  NLU  Integration
  |      |      |
[Azure  [Azure  [Logic
Speech] OpenAI] Apps]
```

### Cost Considerations
Research and note:
- Free tier limitations
- Pay-as-you-go pricing models
- Enterprise agreement options
- Cost optimization strategies

## Part 4: Agent Intelligence Patterns (15 minutes)

### Core Patterns to Understand

**1. Reactive Pattern**
- Stimulus → Response
- Example: FAQ bot responding to keywords

**2. Deliberative Pattern**
- Perceive → Plan → Act
- Example: Travel planning agent

**3. Hybrid Pattern**
- Combines reactive and deliberative
- Example: Customer service with escalation

**4. Multi-Agent Pattern**
- Agents collaborating on complex tasks
- Example: Supply chain optimization

### Activity 4: Pattern Recognition
For each researched company, identify:
- Which pattern(s) they employ
- Why that pattern suits their use case
- Potential pattern evolution
